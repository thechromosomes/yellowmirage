      list rental companies) for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where you book accommodation for other people, we may ask you to provide
      the above information about them (e.g. we will usually ask for the title,
      first name and surname, e-mail address, and nationality of a person for
      each room that you book for identification purposes). You should only
      provide us with information about other people if you have their
      permission to do so.
    </p>
    <p>We may use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Administration and management of room; taxi bookings</li>
      <li>Processing transactions;</li>
      <li>
        Sending you communications about our products and services that we think
        may be of interest to you. We may also send you service information
        communications (e.g. reservation/booking confirmation). With your
        permission, we will keep you informed of news and offers from the Nature
        Roar;
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sharing your personal information with third parties</h4>
    <p>
      We may disclose your personal information to (in so far this is in line
      with applicable local data protection laws):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A buyer in the event that we or any of our assets are acquired by a
        third party (as your information may be one of the transferring assets);
        and/or
      </li>
      <li>
        Any third party where we are under a legal duty to do so, or in order to
        enforce or protect any of our rights, property, or safety (or those of
        our customers). This includes exchanging information with other
        companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and
        credit risk reduction.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Where personal information is processed on our behalf by third parties
      (such as for the purposes of processing your room booking), we put
      measures in place to keep your information secure.
    </p>
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      Our Digital Channels use cookies, which are small text files that contain
      small amounts of information that a website can send to, and store on,
      your computer or device through your browser. Cookies may be used by us to
      provide you with, for example, customized information from our website to
      make it more user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using our Digital Channels, you agree to our privacy and cookie
      policies.
    </p>
    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>
      Nature Roarl takes the security of any personal information we hold very
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where necessary, and in common with other websites and apps, we use SSL
      (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to ensure that personal information
      provided to us is not visible to anybody else when in transit between your
      computer and our servers. You can tell when SSL is in use by the presence
      of a small &quot;padlock&quot; symbol in the status bar of your web
      browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, our web servers are housed behind a secure firewall that
      prevents access to our databases by unauthorized users. All of our servers
      are housed in a secure environment with high levels of physical security.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the transmission of information via the internet is not
      completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data
      transmitted to our site: any transmission is at your risk. Once we have
      received your information, we will handle it in accordance with our usual
      practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where you have chosen a password that enables you to access certain parts
      of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
      We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
    </p>
    <h4>Direct marketing</h4>
    <p>
      We would like to keep you informed of Nature Roar news and offers by,
      phone, email, and other electronic means.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have agreed to receive such marketing communications you may
      opt-out or change your marketing preferences at any time by contacting us.
    </p>
    <h4>Access to and amend your personal information</h4>
    <p>
      We want to make sure that your personal information is accurate and up to
      date. You may ask us to correct or remove personal information you think
      is inaccurate by contacting us.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also have the right to request a copy of the personal information that
      we hold about you. To do so, please contact us. We may make a small charge
      for this service.
    </p>
    <h4>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>

      We keep our privacy policy under regular review and we will place any
      updates on our Digital Channels.
